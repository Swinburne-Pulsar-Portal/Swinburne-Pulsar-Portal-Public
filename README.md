# Submitting Issues
This GitHub repository was created to serve two main purposes, the first is to identify and solve any issues that you face with the Swinburne Pulsar Portal. If there is a documentation error (incorrect/misleading information) or you are experiencing a functionality issue on the Swinburne Pulsar Portal, here's how you can submit a bug report.

In essence, the bug reports encompass both functional errors (things on the portal that aren't working as expected) as well as documentation problems (e.g. grammatical or spelling errors).

To submit a bug report, just click the issues button in the repository menu underneath the GitHub repository name. From there, you will see a button called "New Issue". When you click on that button, it's going to give you a set of issue templates to choose from. When submitting a bug report, click on the issue template named "bug report".

From there, just fill out the information that is being asked. If you have some experience in Markdown (the formatting used in GitHub text files), then this process might be slightly easier (although this information is not required).

Once you have filled out the information to the best of your abilities, click the blue button "Submit New Issue" for your bug report to be submitted.

# Submitting New Tutorial
The second purpose for this GitHub repository is to allow you to submit your tutorials to us so that they can be included on our tutorials page. If you are submitting a tutorial, then the process of submitting a tutorial will be slightly different to submitting a bug report.

It is the same process, the only difference is that instead of choosing the issue template named "bug report", you will instead click on the issue template "new tutorial request". Fill out the information and **please also make sure to include a link to the HTML file for your tutorial**.
